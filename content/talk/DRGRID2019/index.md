[TALK - Prioritizing Resilience: Solutions for Developing Critical Grid Reliability | Priorizar la resiliencia: soluciones para incrementar confiabilidad de la red](https://newenergyevents.com/dr-grid/speakers/emilio-de-jesus-grullon/)

After years of inertia, the utility scale clean energy market has taken off and a number of high profile win and solar projects have been financed and constructed. The nationally mandated goal of 25% clean energy by 2020 is within reach.

In 2018, the Ministry of Energy & Mines announced that the next phase of renewable concessions would be awarded as part of a bid process. Market observers expect the bid to be launched in Q3 or 4 of 2019.

Meanwhile, the market for solar and storage among C&I customers is growing and has huge potential.

Natural gas is carving out a significant portion of the grid. Most recently, plans for a 145 MW combined cycle floating power plant have been announced. The project also incorporates a significant energy storage component.

E-Mobility is in the headlines, too. A joint venture between leading firms was recently announced to develop EV charging infrastructure throughout the Dominican Republic.
