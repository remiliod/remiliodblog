  I am a **[Energy Resilience and Microgrid Researcher](https://microgrid.pucmm.edu.do/)** at PUCMM, where I work on figuring out how to make the energy grid more resilient against climate-driven events. I am also the co-funder of **[Energía Journal](https://anchor.fm/energiajournal)**, a portal to the most relevant information about the world of energy and sustainability in the Dominican Republic. 
  
  I studied Electromechanical Engineering (PUCMM), and obtained a specialization (MEng) in Renewable Energies and Energy Markets (2017). My active research focuses on the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) for the spatial analysis of energy and community resilience, as well as the development of first Microgird Research Laboratory in the Dominican Repulblic.
