## INTRO 

My name is Emilio, I am engineer, time traveler, energy and sustainability researcher, daydreamer and artist currently living in the Dominican Republic. I´m writing this in mid-September 2022, and for the
couple of weeks I have found myself utterly obsessed in the process of experimenting and learning about the nuances and tricks of the new A.I tools.

These tools have brought me a lot of joy, and I hope we can enjoy and shared this amazing opportunity to expand our creativity to the edges of our imagination. Towards that goal through this account, I will be sharing tips, education, and resources of what I’ve learned.

La Mancha Indelible is a short story written by Juan Bosch (30 June 1909 – 1 November 2001, a Dominican novelist, essayist, and political leader. Written when he was in exile in 1960, when the Dominican Republic was governed by a dictatorship, the main argument is that some political parties control the psyche of the people they govern over time, planting ideas and inducing fear that is hard to erase from their consciousness.

La Mujer is a short story written by Juan Bosch, a Dominican novelist, essayist, and political leader. "La Mujer" is one of Bosch's most published stories, a story loaded with reality and an emotional impact whose echo still resonates in our societies, gender violence. The plot of the story is simple: A woman mistreated by her husband and thrown out of her house with her little son is rescued by a stranger. The husband and the stranger fight each other, and the woman kills the man who had helped her.
