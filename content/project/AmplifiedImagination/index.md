### INTRO 

My name is Emilio, I am engineer, time traveler, energy and sustainability researcher, daydreamer and artist currently living in the Dominican Republic. I´m writing this in mid-September 2022, and for the
couple of weeks I have found myself utterly obsessed in the process of experimenting and learning
about the nuances and tricks of the new A.I tools.

These tools have brought me a lot of joy, and I hope we can enjoy and shared this amazing opportunity to expand our creativity to the edges of our imagination. Towards that goal through this account, I will be sharing tips, education, and resources of what I’ve learned..
