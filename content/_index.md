description: I am data driven engineer who loves researching and analyzing facts in order to make decisions and organize ideas. Currently, my energy is invested in helping transition our society from **Carbon & Molecules to Electrons**. I truly believe in the **Transactive Grid** *(Decarbonization, Decentralization, and Digitization)*; we are at the verge of the energy shift that our societies will experience in the coming decades, and as an engineer I will be part of that transformation in our day to day.
